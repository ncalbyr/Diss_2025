A repository for all the code I'm using to complete the dissertation.

1) Fitting x-y primate data to a 2-Dimensional Distance Sampling survey.
2) Building movement function to describe change in primate positions between occasion/observer 1 and occasion/observer 2
3) Building detection/non-detection function
4) Building a function to describe the duplicate process (misidentification between observers)
